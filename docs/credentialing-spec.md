## Implementation Options

### Option A: Canvas Badges (Quick Start)

**Platform:** Canvas + Badgr integration

**Setup:**
1. Create badge in Badgr
2. Connect to Canvas course
3. Set trigger: Module completion
4. Badge auto-issues when student completes all assignments

**Pros:** Low setup, automatic issuance
**Cons:** Limited external visibility, basic verification

**Timeline:** 1-2 hours setup

### Option B: Credly (Recommended for Scale)

**Platform:** Credly Acclaim

**Setup:**
1. Request Credly institutional account (if not existing)
2. Design badge with metadata above
3. Create issuing workflow:
   - Instructor submits completion list
   - SAIL Collaborative reviews (for Silver/Gold)
   - Credly issues badges
4. Students claim badge → appears on LinkedIn

**Pros:** Industry-standard, employer-verifiable, LinkedIn integration
**Cons:** Requires institutional Credly account, manual issuance step

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks initial setup, then ongoing

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

**Bronze:** Auto-issue via Canvas/Badgr
**Silver/Gold:** Issue via Credly with verification

This balances automation with quality control for higher tiers.

## Badge Visual Design

### Design Requirements
- Suffolk University branding compliance
- SAIL Collaborative logo inclusion
- Tier differentiation (Bronze/Silver/Gold visual distinction)
- Accessible color contrast

### Suggested Design Elements
- Compass or navigation motif (SAIL metaphor)
- Four quadrants representing SAIL pillars
- Tier indicated by border color or accent

**Note:** Final design requires approval from Suffolk Marketing/Communications.

---

## Administrative Workflow

### Per-Cohort Process

```
Week 1-3: Students complete module phases
     ↓
Week 3: Instructor submits completion roster
     ↓
Week 3-4: SAIL Collaborative reviews Silver/Gold nominations
     ↓
Week 4: Badges issued
     ↓
Ongoing: Students claim and share badges
```

### Tracking & Reporting

Maintain records of:
- Total badges issued (by tier, by course, by semester)
- Claiming rate (badges issued vs. badges claimed)
- LinkedIn share rate (if trackable)
- Employer verification requests (via Credly analytics)

---

## Integration with AI Fluency Pathway

### Current Pathway Structure
*(To be confirmed with Academic Affairs)*

The SAIL Critical Thinking Module can serve as:
1. **Required component** — All pathway completers must earn this credential
2. **Alternative option** — Students choose this OR another approved module
3. **Elective addition** — Earns additional recognition on top of base pathway

### Recommendation
Position as **required foundational component** — it establishes critical thinking baseline that other pathway elements build upon.

---

## Quality Assurance

### Credential Integrity
- Rubrics standardized across all course implementations
- Annual review of assessment criteria
- Spot-check of Silver/Gold submissions by SAIL Collaborative

### Preventing Credential Inflation
- Bronze requires completion, not just enrollment
- Silver requires demonstrated quality, not just submission
- Gold requires contribution beyond personal completion

## Suggested Task Options

### Option A: Campaign Analysis
Students analyze an existing marketing campaign's effectiveness, then use AI to expand their analysis and recommendations.

**Why it works:**
- AI can generate plausible marketing insights but often misses cultural nuance
- Students must evaluate whether AI "gets" the target audience
- Easy to find real campaigns with available data

### Option B: Consumer Persona Development
Students develop consumer personas for a product/service, then use AI to refine and expand.

**Why it works:**
- AI generates stereotypical personas; students must add authentic depth
- Reveals AI's tendency toward demographic clichés
- Connects directly to marketing practice

### Option C: Content Strategy Critique
Students evaluate a brand's content strategy across channels, then use AI to generate alternative approaches.

**Why it works:**
- AI can generate content ideas but misses brand voice nuances
- Students must judge authenticity and audience fit
- Highly relevant to entry-level marketing roles

## Marketing-Specific AI Limitations to Highlight

When customizing instructions, emphasize these common AI blind spots:

- **Cultural context:** AI often misses regional, generational, or subcultural nuances
- **Brand voice:** AI can mimic but rarely captures authentic brand personality
- **Timing and trends:** AI training data lags current cultural moments
- **Audience insight vs. stereotype:** AI generates plausible but often superficial audience profiles
- **Creative originality:** AI recombines existing ideas; breakthrough creative is rare

## Suggested Reflection Prompts (Marketing-Specific)

### Phase 2 Addition:
> "Where did AI's suggestions feel 'generically marketing' rather than specific to this brand/audience? How could you tell?"

### Phase 3 Addition:
> "In your future marketing role, how will you use AI for ideation vs. execution? Where's the line?"

## Connection to Marketing Careers

Frame the module around common entry-level marketing tasks:
- Social media content creation
- Campaign performance analysis
- Consumer research synthesis
- Creative brief development

Students should see how critical AI evaluation applies to their actual job prospects.

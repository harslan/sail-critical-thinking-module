## Suggested Task Options

### Option A: Company Valuation
Students perform a valuation analysis (DCF, comparables, etc.) for a public company, then use AI to check assumptions and expand analysis.

**Why it works:**
- AI can generate plausible valuation frameworks but often uses outdated data
- Students must verify numbers and challenge AI's assumptions
- Reveals importance of judgment in selecting inputs

### Option B: Investment Memo
Students write an investment recommendation memo, then use AI to strengthen arguments and identify counterarguments.

**Why it works:**
- AI can generate balanced arguments but may miss industry-specific risks
- Students must evaluate whether AI's concerns are material
- Mimics real analyst workflow

### Option C: Financial Statement Analysis
Students analyze a company's financial statements to identify concerns or opportunities, then use AI to expand their analysis.

**Why it works:**
- AI can calculate ratios but often misses contextual interpretation
- Students must judge whether AI's "red flags" are actually significant
- Direct application to accounting/finance careers

## Finance-Specific AI Limitations to Highlight

When customizing instructions, emphasize these common AI blind spots:

- **Data currency:** AI training data lags market conditions; recent events missing
- **Context for numbers:** AI can calculate but struggles to interpret "is this good?"
- **Industry specifics:** AI applies generic frameworks; sector nuances missed
- **Judgment calls:** Discount rates, growth assumptions, terminal values require human judgment
- **Non-public information:** AI can't access company-specific context you might have

## Suggested Reflection Prompts (Finance-Specific)

### Phase 2 Addition:
> "Where did you have to override AI's assumptions? What did you know (from class or research) that AI didn't?"

### Phase 3 Addition:
> "In a professional finance role, when would you trust AI's numbers vs. when would you recalculate yourself? Where's the risk?"

## Ethical Considerations

Finance contexts raise specific AI ethics questions worth addressing:

- **Liability:** Who's responsible if AI-assisted analysis leads to bad investment advice?
- **Disclosure:** Should clients know when AI assisted in analysis?
- **Bias:** AI trained on historical data may perpetuate market biases
- **Speed vs. accuracy:** Pressure to use AI for speed may compromise verification

Include these in Phase 3 Framework discussions.

## Connection to Finance Careers

Frame the module around common entry-level finance tasks:
- Analyst research support
- Due diligence document review
- Financial modeling assistance
- Report and memo drafting

Students should see how critical AI evaluation applies to their actual job prospects.

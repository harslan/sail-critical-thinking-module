# Strategy Adaptation

Sam Rosen's pilot implementation of the SAIL Critical Thinking Module in a business strategy course.

---

## Overview

**Course:** Business Strategy
**Instructor:** Sam Rosen
**Semester:** Fall 2024
**Students:** ~25 undergraduate business students

---

## The Task

### Domain-Specific Assignment

Students analyzed competitive dynamics between Tesla and BYD in the electric vehicle market, requiring:
- Industry analysis
- Competitive positioning assessment
- Strategic recommendations

### Why This Task Works

- **Complex enough** that AI assistance is genuinely useful
- **Domain-specific enough** that AI makes predictable errors (missing context, outdated data)
- **Open-ended enough** that multiple valid approaches exist
- **Relevant** to students' career interests

---

## Three-Phase Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation
Students completed initial competitive analysis without AI, relying on course concepts, case materials, and their own reasoning.

**Key observation:** Many students struggled with integrating multiple frameworks — this became valuable baseline data.

### Phase 2: AI Integration
Students revisited their analysis with full AI access, documenting their interactions and critically evaluating AI contributions.

**Student insight captured:**
> "One of the most significant obstacles I encountered was staying critical about myself when AI made the process of writing so simple and quick. Since it generated entire paragraphs in real-time, it was too easy to receive the responses as final rather than evaluating whether they were relevant to our class structures. I observed that the more I was depending on it, the less I was thinking about the concepts of underlying strategies."

This quote exemplifies the metacognitive awareness the module develops.

### Phase 3: Leadership
Students developed personal frameworks for AI use in strategic analysis contexts, with attention to:
- When AI assists vs. when it substitutes for strategic thinking
- How to verify AI's industry knowledge
- Communication of AI-assisted analysis to stakeholders

## Workflow Model

Sam developed a Human→AI→Human→AI iterative workflow that students practiced:

```
Human (Initial Thinking)
    ↓ Draft ideas, identify questions
AI (First Pass)
    ↓ Generate options, surface considerations
Human (Critical Evaluation)
    ↓ Evaluate, select, refine, add context
AI (Refinement)
    ↓ Polish, expand, check consistency
Human (Final Judgment)
    ↓ Verify, take ownership, decide
```

This model helps students see AI as part of a process, not a replacement for the process.

## Adaptations Made

### What Stayed Generic
- Three-phase structure
- Reflection prompts
- Documentation requirements
- Peer review process

### What Was Customized
- The specific analytical task (Tesla/BYD analysis)
- Domain-specific examples in instructions
- References to course frameworks (Porter, etc.)
- Industry-specific AI limitations to watch for

---

## Results & Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Students who struggled in Phase 1 became the most insightful critics in Phase 2
- Documentation requirement surfaced authentic engagement
- Peer review generated high-quality discussion

### Challenges Encountered
- Some students needed coaching on "what counts" as documentation
- Phase 1 deadline enforcement required vigilance
- Time management across three phases needed clear scaffolding

### Recommendations for Other Strategy Courses
1. Choose a case with fast-changing dynamics (AI will have outdated information)
2. Emphasize that Phase 1 quality doesn't determine Phase 2 grade
3. Share the metacognitive quote above early — it validates the struggle

## Phase 1 Assignments

### Phase 1 Reflection Prompt

```
Phase 1 Reflection

Now that you've completed the task without AI assistance, take 10 minutes to reflect honestly.

1. What was the hardest part of this task? Why did you find it challenging?

2. Where were you most uncertain? What did you wish you knew more about?

3. What resources did you use (textbooks, notes, articles)? What resources did you wish you had?

4. If you could have used AI, what specific questions would you have asked it?

Be honest — this reflection helps you learn, and there's no penalty for acknowledging uncertainty.

Word count: 200-400 words
Due: [DATE]

## Phase 2 Assignments

### Interaction Documentation Instructions

```
Interaction Documentation

Submit evidence of your actual AI interactions during this phase.

What to include:
- Screenshots or exports showing your conversations with AI
- Minimum 3 distinct interaction moments (not just one long conversation)
- Your initial prompts, AI responses, and any follow-up questions

How to capture:
- Screenshots: Use your device's screenshot function
- Exports: Many AI tools allow conversation export (look in settings)
- Copy/paste: If needed, copy text into a document with timestamps

What we're looking for:
✓ Real working process (messy is fine!)
✓ Evidence you iterated and refined your prompts
✓ Moments where you pushed back or asked follow-ups

What raises concerns:
✗ Suspiciously perfect, linear conversations
✗ No evidence of iteration or correction
✗ Conversations that look staged after the fact

Upload as: PDF, images, or document file
Due: [DATE]
```

### Critical Reflection Prompt

```
Critical Reflection on AI Interaction

Reflect on your experience using AI for this task. Address each question with specific examples from your interaction documentation.

1. What did AI do BETTER than your Phase 1 attempt?
   Be specific: Quote or describe what AI provided and explain why it was valuable.
   Example: "AI suggested considering [X factor] which I hadn't thought of because..."

2. What did AI get WRONG or miss entirely?
   Be specific: What errors, gaps, or misleading suggestions did you notice?
   Example: "AI claimed [X] but this ignores [important context] that matters because..."

3. What did you have to CORRECT, OVERRIDE, or SUPPLEMENT?
   Be specific: Where did you use your own judgment to improve on AI's output?
   Example: "I initially accepted AI's framing but changed it because..."

4. How did your Phase 1 experience help you EVALUATE AI's output?
   Connect the phases: How did working without AI first prepare you to assess AI's contributions?
   Example: "Because I'd struggled with [X] in Phase 1, I noticed when AI..."

5. What surprised you about AI's performance in this domain?
   Reflect: Did AI exceed or fall short of your expectations? How?

Word count: 500-800 words

Grading note: We value specificity and genuine critical engagement over polished writing. A rough but honest reflection with concrete examples will score higher than a smooth but generic response.

## Phase 3 Assignments

### Personal AI Use Framework Prompt

```
Personal AI Use Framework

Develop your personal framework for using AI in your professional work. This should be specific to your intended career path — generic guidelines that could apply to anyone will receive lower marks.

Address each of the following areas:

1. WHEN I WILL USE AI
   • What specific tasks or situations call for AI assistance?
   • Why is AI appropriate for these tasks?
   • What AI tools or approaches will you use?
   
2. WHEN I WILL NOT USE AI
   • What tasks or situations are off-limits for AI?
   • Why is AI inappropriate or risky for these?
   • What will you do instead?

3. HOW I WILL VERIFY AI OUTPUTS
   • What's your process for checking AI's work?
   • What sources, methods, or tests will you use?
   • How will you decide what needs verification vs. what you'll trust?

4. WHEN AI AND I DISAGREE
   • What's your process when your judgment conflicts with AI's suggestion?
   • How will you decide who's right?
   • When will you seek additional input or escalate?

5. HOW I WILL COMMUNICATE MY AI USE
   • How will you explain your AI practices to supervisors?
   • To clients or customers?
   • To colleagues or team members?

Format options:
- Written document (500-800 words), OR
- Structured outline with brief explanations for each point

Your framework should be something you could actually use starting in your first professional role.

Due: [DATE]
```

### Peer Review Prompt

```
Peer Review: AI Use Framework

You've been assigned to review a classmate's Personal AI Use Framework.

Read their framework carefully and thoughtfully, then provide feedback on these three areas:

1. STRENGTH (What works well)
   What's the strongest element of their framework? What did they think through particularly well? Be specific about what impressed you.

2. GAP (What's missing)
   What risk, situation, or consideration did they not address that they probably should? What might they encounter professionally that their framework doesn't cover?

3. QUESTION (What needs clarification)
   What's one question you'd want them to answer to strengthen their framework? This should be a genuine question that would help them improve, not a criticism disguised as a question.

Tone: Constructive and collegial. Your peer put thought into this — engage seriously with their work.

Word count: 150-250 words
Due: [DATE]

Note: Thoughtful, specific feedback earns full marks. Generic praise ("Great job!") or vague criticism ("Could be more specific") does not.
```

## Metacognitive Check-In Prompts (Optional)

These short prompts can be embedded during phases for real-time reflection. Time-limited completion (5-10 minutes) encourages authentic responses.

### Phase 1 Check-In
```
Quick Check-In (5 minutes)

You're partway through the Phase 1 task. Pause and answer:

1. What's one assumption you've made that you're not 100% sure about?

2. What would make you more confident in your approach right now?

This isn't graded for correctness — just complete it honestly.
```

### Phase 2 Check-In
```
Quick Check-In (5 minutes)

You've been working with AI for a bit. Pause and answer:

1. What's one thing AI suggested that you initially accepted but now have questions about?

2. What's one thing you know that AI seems to be missing?

This isn't graded for correctness — just complete it honestly.
```

### Phase 3 Check-In
```
Quick Check-In (5 minutes)

You're developing your AI Use Framework. Pause and answer:

1. What's the hardest decision you're making in your framework — the one you're least certain about?

2. How might your framework be different in 5 years vs. today?

This isn't graded for correctness — just complete it honestly.
```

## Adaptation Notes

### Discipline-Specific Examples

When adapting these prompts, add domain-relevant examples:

**Marketing:**
"Example: AI claimed this campaign would resonate with Gen Z, but it missed the cultural context that..."

**Finance:**
"Example: AI's valuation model suggested X, but it didn't account for the recent regulatory changes affecting..."

**Accounting:**
"Example: AI flagged this transaction as routine, but the timing suggests potential revenue recognition issues because..."

**Management:**
"Example: AI recommended restructuring approach X, but this ignores the organizational culture factors that..."

### Adjusting Word Counts

The suggested word counts assume traditional semester-length courses. Adjust as needed:
- Compressed module: Reduce by 30-40%
- Extended/graduate: Increase by 20-30%
- Focus on quality indicators, not length

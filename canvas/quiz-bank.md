# Quiz Bank (Optional)

Optional knowledge-check questions. Use sparingly — reflection-based assessment is more valuable than quizzes for this module's learning objectives.

## When to Use Quizzes

**Appropriate uses:**
- Low-stakes comprehension check before assignments
- Ensuring students read instructions
- Quick pulse on conceptual understanding

**Not recommended:**
- High-stakes assessment of AI ethics knowledge (students will use AI)
- Testing "correct" answers about AI capabilities (changes rapidly)
- Replacing reflection-based assessment

## SAIL Framework Comprehension

*Purpose: Check understanding of the four pillars*

### Question 1
Match each SAIL pillar with its description:

S - Social Intelligence → Communicating AI decisions to diverse stakeholders
A - AI Literacy → Understanding capabilities, limitations, and appropriate use
I - Innovation/Inquiry → Questioning outputs and pushing beyond first answers

### Question 2
Which SAIL pillar is MOST relevant when you're explaining to a client why you used AI for part of their project?

a) AI Literacy
b) Innovation/Inquiry
c) Social Intelligence ✓
d) Leadership

### Question 3
Which SAIL pillar is MOST relevant when you notice AI gave a confident but incorrect answer?

a) AI Literacy
b) Innovation/Inquiry ✓
c) Social Intelligence
d) Leadership

## Reflection Quality Self-Assessment

*Purpose: Help students evaluate their own reflection before submission*

### Question 1
Read your Phase 2 reflection draft. Does it include at least one SPECIFIC quote or example from your AI interaction?

a) Yes, I cite specific AI outputs ✓
b) No, I speak generally about AI

*If no: Go back and add specific examples from your documentation.*

### Question 2
Could someone else in a different discipline write exactly the same reflection you wrote?

a) Yes, my reflection is pretty generic
b) No, my reflection is specific to my field and my interaction ✓

*If yes: Add discipline-specific details and examples.*

### Question 3
Did you connect your Phase 2 experience back to what happened in Phase 1?

a) Yes, I explain how Phase 1 prepared me to evaluate AI ✓
b) No, I treat them as separate assignments

*If no: Add a paragraph connecting the two phases.*

## Usage Notes

### Canvas Setup
- Set quizzes to allow unlimited attempts (learning, not gatekeeping)
- Don't count heavily toward final grade (5% maximum)
- Use "show correct answer after submission" for immediate feedback

### Alternative: Discussion Prompts

Instead of quizzes, consider brief discussion posts:

**Before Phase 2:**
"Based on your Phase 1 experience, what's ONE specific thing you plan to ask AI about? Why?"

**Before Phase 3:**
"What's the hardest decision you'll have to make in your AI Use Framework?"

These are harder to "cheat" and generate richer engagement.

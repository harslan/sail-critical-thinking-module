## Detailed Page Content

### Welcome & Overview

#### Page: Module Introduction
```
Welcome to the SAIL Critical Thinking Module

In this module, you'll develop something more valuable than AI skills — 
you'll develop the judgment to know when AI helps, when it misleads, 
and how to maintain your professional expertise in an AI-augmented world.

This matters because:
- Employers expect you to use AI effectively AND evaluate it critically
- AI will make mistakes in your field; your job is to catch them
- The professionals who thrive will be those who lead AI, not follow it

Over the next [X weeks], you'll:
1. Complete a professional task using only your own knowledge
2. Repeat it with AI — and document everything
3. Develop your personal framework for Human-AI collaboration

Let's begin.
```

#### Page: The SAIL Framework
```
The SAIL Framework

This module is built on Suffolk University's SAIL Framework for AI literacy:

S - Social Intelligence
    Communicating about AI to colleagues, clients, and stakeholders

A - AI Literacy  
    Understanding what AI can and cannot do in your field

I - Innovation/Inquiry
    Questioning AI outputs; pushing beyond first answers

L - Leadership
    Taking responsibility for how you use AI in your work

By the end of this module, you'll have practiced all four pillars.
```

#### Page: What You'll Learn
```
Learning Outcomes

By completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Perform professional tasks independently, establishing baseline competence
2. Use AI tools strategically while maintaining critical awareness
3. Identify AI errors, limitations, and hidden assumptions in your domain
4. Articulate a personal framework for responsible AI use
5. Communicate your AI use practices to professional stakeholders

These skills are increasingly essential across all business functions.
```

### Phase 1: Foundation

#### Page: Phase 1 Instructions
```
Phase 1: Think Without the Crutch

Before you can evaluate AI, you need to know what good work looks like 
on your own.

In this phase, you'll complete a professional task WITHOUT any AI assistance. 
This isn't about proving you don't need AI — it's about establishing your 
baseline so you can meaningfully evaluate AI's contributions later.

Rules for Phase 1:
- No ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, or other AI tools
- No asking friends to use AI on your behalf
- You MAY use traditional resources: textbooks, articles, your notes

This might feel harder than usual. That's the point. Notice where you 
struggle — that awareness will be valuable in Phase 2.

Due: [DATE]
```

#### Assignment: Foundation Task
```
[INSTRUCTOR: Replace this with your discipline-specific task]

Assignment: [Task Name]

Instructions:
[Your specific instructions here]

Submission Requirements:
- [Your requirements]
- Submit as [format]

Reminder: No AI assistance permitted for this assignment.
```

#### Assignment: Phase 1 Reflection
```
Phase 1 Reflection

Now that you've completed the task, take 10 minutes to reflect.

Answer these questions honestly (there's no "right" answer):

1. What was the hardest part of this task? Why?

2. Where were you most uncertain? What did you wish you knew?

3. What resources did you use? What resources did you wish you had?

4. If you could have used AI, what would you have asked it?

Word count: 200-400 words
```

### Phase 2: AI Integration

#### Page: Phase 2 Instructions
```
Phase 2: Use AI, But Question Everything

Now you'll revisit the same task — this time with full AI access.

But here's the difference: you're not just using AI. You're studying it.

Your job in this phase:
1. Complete or extend your Phase 1 work using AI
2. Document your AI interactions (screenshots, exports)
3. Critically evaluate what AI contributed — and what it got wrong

The goal isn't a better final product. The goal is deeper understanding of 
how AI performs in your professional domain.

Due: [DATE]
```

#### Page: How to Document AI Interactions
```
Documenting Your AI Interactions

We need to see your actual working process — not a polished final conversation.

What to capture:
✓ Your initial prompts (even the awkward first attempts)
✓ AI's responses
✓ Your follow-up questions or corrections
✓ Moments where you changed direction
✓ Times you pushed back on AI's suggestions

How to capture it:
- Screenshots: Use your device's screenshot function
- Exports: Many AI tools let you export conversation history
- Copy/paste: If needed, paste into a document with timestamps

What we're looking for:
- Real messiness (that's how actual work looks)
- Evidence of iteration and refinement
- Moments of critical evaluation

What raises red flags:
- Suspiciously clean, linear conversations
- No evidence of follow-up or correction
- Conversations that could have been staged after the fact
```

#### Assignment: AI-Augmented Task
```
AI-Augmented Task

Revisit your Phase 1 work. With AI assistance, either:
- Improve and refine your original submission, OR
- Extend it to address aspects you couldn't tackle before

You may use any AI tools: ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, etc.

Submit your revised/extended work product.
```

#### Assignment: Interaction Documentation
```
Interaction Documentation

Submit documentation of your AI interactions during this phase.

Include:
- Screenshots or exports of your AI conversations
- Minimum 3 distinct interaction moments
- Cover your initial attempts, refinements, and final exchanges

Upload as: PDF, images, or document file

Note: Authentic working process is valued over polished conversations.
```

#### Assignment: Critical Reflection
```
Critical Reflection on AI Interaction

Reflect on your AI-assisted work by addressing each question:

1. What did AI do BETTER than your Phase 1 attempt? Be specific.
   (Example: "AI suggested [X] which I hadn't considered because...")

2. What did AI get WRONG or miss entirely? Be specific.
   (Example: "AI claimed [X] but this ignores [context/factor]...")

3. What did you have to CORRECT, OVERRIDE, or SUPPLEMENT?
   (Example: "I accepted AI's suggestion on [X] but changed [Y] because...")

4. How did your Phase 1 experience help you EVALUATE AI's output?
   (Example: "Because I'd struggled with [X], I noticed when AI...")

5. What surprised you about AI's performance in this domain?

Word count: 500-800 words

Grading focus: Specificity and genuine critical engagement, not writing polish.
```

### Phase 3: Leadership

#### Page: Phase 3 Instructions
```
Phase 3: Own Your Human-AI Partnership

You've now experienced professional work both with and without AI. 
You've seen where it helps and where it fails.

Now it's time to articulate YOUR approach.

In this phase, you'll develop a Personal AI Use Framework — a set of 
guidelines for how YOU will use (and not use) AI in your professional work.

This isn't about right answers. It's about thoughtful, principled decisions 
you can explain and defend.

Due: [DATE]
```

#### Assignment: Personal AI Use Framework
```
Personal AI Use Framework

Develop your personal framework for AI use in your professional context.

Address each of these areas:

1. WHEN I WILL USE AI
   - What tasks or situations?
   - Why is AI appropriate here?
   - What specific tools or approaches?

2. WHEN I WILL NOT USE AI
   - What tasks or situations?
   - Why is AI inappropriate or risky here?
   - What will I do instead?

3. HOW I WILL VERIFY AI OUTPUTS
   - What's your checking process?
   - What sources or methods will you use?
   - When will you trust vs. verify?

4. WHEN AI AND I DISAGREE
   - What's your process when your judgment conflicts with AI?
   - How do you decide who's right?
   - When do you escalate or seek other input?

5. HOW I WILL COMMUNICATE MY AI USE
   - How will you explain your AI practices to supervisors?
   - To clients or customers?
   - To colleagues?

Format: Written document (500-800 words) OR structured outline with explanations

Be specific to your intended professional role — generic guidelines receive lower marks.
```

#### Assignment: Peer Review
```
Peer Review

You've been assigned to review a classmate's AI Use Framework.

Read their framework carefully, then provide feedback:

1. STRENGTH: What's the strongest element of their framework? 
   What did they think through particularly well?

2. GAP: What risk, situation, or consideration did they not address? 
   What might they need to add?

3. QUESTION: What's one question you'd want them to answer to strengthen 
   their framework?

Word count: 150-250 words

Note: Thoughtful, constructive feedback that helps your peer improve their 
framework. Generic praise or criticism receives lower marks.
```
